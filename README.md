### Someting you should know 
>(^_^)<
Hi, everybody! I'm the PxAutoMessage plugin's author.
This plugin has been developed for over a year, and I thank you for your support.
In version 1.0 of this plugin, it only sends chat messages to players at regular intervals.
In version 2.0 of this plug-in, in addition to sending chat messages to the player, it also sends title, action bar, and Boss bar messages to the player.

But, at version 3.0, I will deliver on what I promised:

* Standard Json support;
* Internationalization (multilingual) support;
* Command binding support for chat bar announcements;
* Full functionality support for higher version game servers.

In the future, please support me a lot!
