# PxAutoMessage
A special Minecraft automatic announcement plugin.

### Someting you should know >(^_^)<
Hi, everybody! I'm the PxAutoMessage plugin's author.</br>
This plugin has been developed for over a year, and I thank you for your support.</br>
In version 1.0 of this plugin, it only sends chat messages to players at regular intervals.</br>
In version 2.0 of this plugin, in addition to sending chat messages to the player, it also sends title, action bar, and Boss bar messages to the player.</br>

But, at version 3.0, I will deliver on what I promised:

* Standard Json support;
* Internationalization (multilingual) support;
* Command binding support for chat announcements;
* Full functionality support for higher version game servers.

In the future, please support me a lot!
Thanks!
